## 🤖 AI Support Explanation

As a beginner coder, I relied heavily on AI tools throughout this project to guide my learning and development process:

- 🧠 **ChatGPT** – Helped me create a detailed step-by-step development plan and guided the structure of each feature
- 🧩 **IBM Granite** – Assisted in generating functional code snippets from modular ideas
- 🔄 **Blackbox** – Enabled me to extract and refactor code from related open-source repositories

I also documented my process visually and can include supporting images showing how I integrated these tools to turn a simple idea into a functioning application.

This project demonstrates not just my technical implementation skills, but also how AI tools can empower self-learning and accelerate development, especially for those just starting in the tech world.
